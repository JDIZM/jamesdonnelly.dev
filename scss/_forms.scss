// Blocks
// Encapsulates a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. While blocks can be nested and interact with each other, 
// semantically they remain equal; there is no precedence or hierarchy. Holistic entities without DOM representation 
// (such as controllers or models) can be blocks as well.

// Elements
// Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. Any element is semantically tied to its block.

// Modifers 
// Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior or state.
