Remote working has its benefits. Less traveling (usually) and being able to work in your underwear being the two obvious ones. Whether your working from home, at a coffee shop or in a co-working space it’s easy to get side-tracked from what needs doing. It requires discipline to stay focused and remain productive when you're in full control.

#### Avoiding Distractions

Distractions break your flow, they take you out of the zone and destroy your productivity. How do we avoid distractions when working remotely?

Regardless of where your working you’ll need to be able to manage your time effectively and avoid distractions.

#### How To Manage Time Effectively

I struggled with managing my time until I learned a few basic tricks that allowed me to boost my output and push to production much faster.

Time management is a skill, and like any skill, it can be learned. You just need to know how, so let me show you.

#### Productivity Hacks

Get yourself comfortable, load up that chillout playlist you recently compiled on Spotify and slip on the noise-canceling headphones. You're about to get productive.

#### Flow - Getting In The Zone

Have you ever been so immersed in something you're almost running on autopilot, in the zone, channeling your inner focus? That’s what we call flow, a mental state of focus and being so involved in what you're doing that your sense of space and time becomes distorted.

Hungarian-American Psychologist [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) recognised and named the psychological concept of flow.

There's a fine line, a goldilocks zone, where we maintain a state of flow. This balance needs to be maintained. Have you ever been tilted in a game and lost your groove?

So how do we achieve a state of flow?

> To achieve a flow state, a balance must be struck between the challenge of the task and the skill of the performer. If the task is too easy or too difficult, flow cannot occur. Both skill level and challenge level must be matched and high; if skill and challenge are low and matched, then apathy results

According to Csikszentmihályi, there are nine components to achieving a state of flow.

1. challenge-skill balance
2. merging of action and awareness
3. clarity of goals
4. immediate and unambiguous feedback
5. concentration on the task at hand
6. the paradox of control - having control over the situation or the outcome
7. transformation of time
8. loss of self-consciousness
9. autotelic experience (for self-benefit and experience of the task as the main goal, “I just want to do it, because I felt like it”)

#### The Pomodoro Technique

##### What's a pomodoro?
<!-- ##### 2. Pros and cons -->

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

This is a simple technique that’s designed to get things done with a clear focus. The goal of the Pomodoro Technique is to have a complete focus on the task we’re doing. We can’t be distracted and must remain focused until the timer rings.

Each interval of 25-minute is one Pomodoro. With Four Pomodoro’s in one set.

If you break down your work into smaller tasks with a clear goal for each 25 minutes Pomodoro, then take a short break for 5 minutes and return.

Mark them down on a piece of paper with an x once each is completed. At the end of the set of four take a longer 30-minute break. Go for a walk, get some fresh air and get a screen break. This can also help with creativity because you’ll be taking in extra sights, sounds, and senses.

You might have a larger task and want to skip the breaks between intervals, then carve out a clear block of time (2 hours) where you will have complete focus and won’t be distracted.

#### Wrapping Up

I find these two techniques work together well. Okay so maybe flow isn’t a technique as such, but having knowledge and awareness enables you to use it to your advantage.

The Pomodoro Technique enables me to achieve a state of flow quite easily. I’ll always try to challenge myself and learn something new on each Pomodoro, this generally leads me down a rabbit hole of productivity.
